# performance-matters-server-side
This is the repo of the assignment 2 of Performance Matters: Server Side.
The goal of the assignment was to adapt an excisting app from client side to server side. The server runs on Node.js, and several packages. I've never worked with Node.js before, so I had quite some mental breakdowns.

## The app
For this assignment I took the web app I made for Web Apps From Scratch (WAFS). The intention of the assignment was to take a assignment I made for the OBA, that used SPARQL. The first two days I tried to make it work, but I had so many issues with SPARQL, that I decided to use my WAFS assignment, which uses a regular API. 

Because of the time we had for the project (one week), we only had to implement the main goal of the web app. My web app only had one goal, since it wasn't very advanced. I struggled for 3,5 days, and since I had to do another assignment as well, I was happy that I had something working.
